------------

HPPC was written for selfish needs and because (at the time it was conceived) no
other library offered a commercially permissive license.

Nowadays there are a number of options to choose from (alphabetically).

* fastutil (by Sebastiano Vigna), http://fastutil.di.unimi.it/
  A very flexible, Apache licensed set of collections and algorithms. 
  Compatible with Java Collections.

* HPPC-RT (by Vincent Sonnier), https://github.com/vsonnier/hppc
  A fork of HPPC for real-time computing, minimizes allocations, introduces
  overhead-less iterators and other miscellaneous goodies.
  
* Koloboke (by Roman Leventov), https://github.com/OpenHFT/Koloboke
  A very impressive library that offers unprecedented speed and features.
  Includes support for Java8 (including Collections compatibility).

* PCJ (by Søren Bak), http://pcj.sourceforge.net/
  The grand-daddy of them all. :) DO NOT use it, it contains bugs. But it
  deserves to be mentioned nonetheless.

* Trove, https://bitbucket.org/robeden/trove/
  If you're a GNU fan, this may be just the sweet spot for you.
